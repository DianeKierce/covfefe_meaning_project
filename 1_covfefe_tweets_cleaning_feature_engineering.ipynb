    " \n",
    "#### Data Source:\n",
    "On June 14-15, 2017 I used twitterscraper (https://github.com/taspinar/twitterscraper) to download all available tweets that matched the search term \"covfefe\" through Twitter's search function. The initial data set contained 531,980 tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In this notebook:\n",
    "This notebook contains the code I used to eliminate irrelevant tweets, preprocess the text, and engineer new features using word counts, word stemming, noun phrase extraction, detecting URL's and pictures in the tweets, and detecting where \"covfefe\" appears (in the tweet or in the user name)."
